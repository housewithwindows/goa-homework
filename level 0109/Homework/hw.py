Solutions for Exponent Exercises

A: Zero and Negative Exponents

Example: Simplify -2x^{-3}
Solution:
Rewrite x^{-3} as 1/x^3.
So, -2x^{-3} becomes -2 / x^3.

Answer: -2/x^3


B: Product Rule

Example: Simplify 5x^3 * 3x^2
Solution:
Multiply the coefficients: 5 * 3 = 15.
Then, add the exponents for x: x^3 * x^2 = x^(3+2) = x^5.

Answer: 15x^5


C: Quotient Rule

Example: Simplify (10x^5) / (2x^3)
Solution:
Divide the coefficients: 10 / 2 = 5.
Then, subtract the exponents for x: x^5 / x^3 = x^(5-3) = x^2.

Answer: 5x^2
