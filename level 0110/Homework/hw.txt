Extended Solutions for Exponent and Logarithmic Exercises

Section 14.21: Solving Exponential Equations

Example 1) 3^{x+1} + 3^x = 108
Solution:
Rewrite 3^{x+1} as 3 * 3^x to get the equation: 3 * 3^x + 3^x = 108.
Factor out 3^x: 3^x (3 + 1) = 108, so 3^x * 4 = 108.
Divide by 4: 3^x = 27.
Since 27 = 3^3, we get x = 3.

Answer: x = 3


Section 14.25: Combining Exponential Expressions

Example 5) 27^{3 + 1} / 9^2 - 3^{x+1} = 163
Solution:
Rewrite each base as a power of 3: 27 = 3^3 and 9 = 3^2.
Thus, 27^{3 + 1} = (3^3)^{3 + 1} = 3^{3*(3+1)} = 3^{12}.
Similarly, 9^2 = (3^2)^2 = 3^4.
Rewrite the equation using these values.

This simplifies to:

Answer: [Write solution here]


Section 14.29: Solving Logarithmic Equations

Example 1) log_2(x) = 0
Solution:
Rewrite in exponential form: 2^0 = x, so x = 1.

Answer: x = 1


Example 5- log_(1/2)(x) = -3
Solution:
Rewrite in exponential form: (1/2)^{-3} = x.
Since (1/2)^{-3} = 2^3 = 8, we get x = 8.

Answer: x = 8
